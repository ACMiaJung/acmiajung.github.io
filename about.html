      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Hello, World! Welcome to my <strong><em>About Me</em></strong> page:)</p>
      <p>I am a 21-year-old undergraduate studying computer science & the liberal arts at Amherst College. </p>
      <h2>Biographical Sketch</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I was born in <strong><em>Seoul, Korea</em></strong>.
            I moved around many, many times during my childhood, but I spent the most time in the cities of <strong><em>Changwon</em></strong> and <strong><em>Masan</em></strong> (areas in the southern end of South Korea, where my parents and my family are from), and <strong><em>Bucheon</em> </strong>(a city right in between Seoul and Incheon). 
          </li>
          <li>
            I lived in <strong><em>Atlanta, Georgia</em></strong> when I was seven, but moved back to Korea after half a year. I still miss the deep green woods, the friendly ducks and the wild deer:) I don't miss the summer mosquitos, though!
          </li>
          <li>
            After living for about 12 years in Korea, I moved to <strong><em>Los Angeles, California</em></strong>. My young self thought that America = = the land of the flora and fauna I was used to seeing in Georgia, so I was quite shocked by the cracked dry asphalt, giant chunks of cacti, and tall palm trees of LA.
          </li>
          <li>
             Then I moved to a city in the Los Angeles county area called <strong><em>Glendale</em></strong>, where I attended John Muir Elementary school from 5th to 6th grade. Here, I furthered my English skills and made a diverse group of friends! Shout out to Izzy, Julie, Daisy, Ana, and Sofia if you're out there somewhere:)
          </li>
          <li>
            Then I moved to <strong><em>South Pasadena</em></strong>, another suburban city in the LA area, in which I spent about 7 years- this was the longest time I've stayed in one place without moving. Many of my childhood (middle school & high school) friends are from this area.
          </li>
          <li>
             I then decided to move to the opposite end of the country- from California to Massachusetts- to attend <strong><em>Amherst College</em></strong>! The first few years in college, I was torn between studying in preparation for medical school, taking as many music classes as my heart desired, and exploring computer science (which I was exposed to in high school- Mr.Shorr, if you're seeing this, you changed my life forever). I ultimately decided to focus on learning computer science, and I'm looking to become a software engineer!  
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Some Interesting Interests</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
            I am a first-degree black belt in TaeKwonDo, a Korean martial art that I've been practicing since I was young. I've puased my training for a few years now, but my favorite practice was weaponry, poomsae (sequences of memorized defense-and-attack techniques), and, wait for it... jump ropes. Yes, jump roping is a serious training method in TaeKwonDo.
            </li>
            <li>
            I sang as a soprano in an A Capella group for 2 years in college! I became a little music'ed out after simultaneously being in 2 choral groups and an A Capella group WHILE taking music classes as well as vocal lessons, so I'm taking a break from for now.
            </li>
           <li>
            I am a certified Massachusetts EMT (Emergency Medical Technician). I taught a nationally-certified EMT course of 30 students and passed on hands-on life-saving skills such as CPR, Medical and Trauma Assessment, Splinting, and more. I currently run one to two 12-hour shifts and respond to emergency calls in the Amherst College campus every week.
           </li>
           <li>
            I love all animals, but birds have a special place in my heart. I had two budgies named Happy and Angel, and a canary-winged parakeet named Cookie:)
